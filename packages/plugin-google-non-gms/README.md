# Module plugin-google-non-gms

This plugin follows the same setup as Google GMS plugin. You can find the documentation [here](/packages/plugin-google-gms/README.md).

## Escape Hatch

This plugin does not provides an escape hatch to access the native Google Android SDK, as it uses REST API instead.

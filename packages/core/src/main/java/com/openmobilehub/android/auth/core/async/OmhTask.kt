/**
 * A wrapper class for the async library that's used in a specific OMH implementation. This creates
 * a layer of abstraction between the developer and the library that doesn't force the preferred async
 * library on them.
 *
 * This will work akin to the Rx libraries which give you a disposable object to cancel any async
 * functionalities that are in execution, thus giving you a bit of control over the async operations.
 * It also allows you to add [onSuccess] and [onFailure] listeners in a modular way to react to the
 * outcomes.
 *
 * The [execute] function is important to obtain the [OmhCancellable] that allows you to cancel any
 * currently running async operation. Because not all libraries have a way to cancel async operations,
 * the [OmhCancellable] is returned as nullable.

# `OMH Starter Code`

This branch contains the basic starting codebase for the OMH Auth Client Library with all the
providers already set-up.
The only thing required to run the application is to set-up individual providers in their respective web consoles and to provide `local.properties` file with the following keys:

```
# Google
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=

# Facebook
FACEBOOK_APP_ID=
FACEBOOK_CLIENT_TOKEN=

# Microsoft
MICROSOFT_CLIENT_ID=
MICROSOFT_SIGNATURE_HASH=

# Dropbox
DROPBOX_APP_KEY=
```

> You can learn more about provider setup from
> the [provider specific setup]("https://github.com/openmobilehub/android-omh-auth#provider-specific-setup")
> section in the main branch's README.

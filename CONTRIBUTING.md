# How to contribute

Bug reports and pull requests from users are what keep this project working.

## Basics

1. Create an issue and describe your idea
2. [Fork it](https://github.com/openmobilehub/android-omh-auth/fork)
3. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b my-new-feature`)
4. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Add some feature'`)
5. Publish the branch (`git push origin my-new-feature`)
6. Create a new Pull Request

## Running for development

For running the plugin in development locally, there are primarily three things to be achieved compared to standard development scenario:

- `repositories` need to include `mavenLocal()`
- publishing needs to happen to maven local
- signing needs to be disabled for publishing

To achieve that, this plugin has been preconfigured with conditional configuration that can be enabled as follows:

1. Via `local.properties` (applies both to Android Studio and `gradlew`): add `isLocalDevelopment=true`

2. Via a CLI flag: `./gradlew -P isLocalDevelopment=true ...`

## Publishing

1. With Android Studio -> Gradle tab and run the `publishToMavenLocal` in the `packages > core`, `packages > plugin-google-gms` and `packages > plugin-google-non-gms`:

![gradle-auth-core](https://github.com/openmobilehub/omh-maps/assets/124717244/7a8aeb52-fcf2-4c8c-a0e8-e249e69b3fea)
![gradle-auth-plugin-google-gms](https://github.com/openmobilehub/omh-maps/assets/124717244/e5a370d9-1429-4234-a884-b39a23c6dadb)
![gradle-auth-plugin-google-non-gms](https://github.com/openmobilehub/omh-maps/assets/124717244/2cc52110-8faa-47e3-9298-a6cec846a348)

**Note**: to publish all modules in `packages/`, you can simply run the task `publishToMavenLocal` in the root project.

2. With the CLI:

- to publish all modules: `./gradlew publishToMavenLocal`
- to publish a selected module: `./gradlew :packages:{module}:publishToMavenLocal`

**Note**: to publish all modules in `packages/`, you can simply run the task `publishToMavenLocal` in the root project directory.

#### Step 2: Verify plugin is published

Go to `/Users/your_user/.m2` dot folder and you'll find the plugin.

#### Step 3: Debug

Add some prints to debug the code

#### Step 4: Test it

Create a sample project, add the plugin and sync the project with gradle and you'll see logs in the `Build` tab in Android Studio.

## Checking your work

You can verify your code with the following tasks:

```
./gradlew assemble
./gradlew detekt
```

Once you have made a change in any of the `packages/core`, `packages/plugin-google-gms` or `packages/plugin-google-non-gms` modules, you must `publishToMavenLocal` in that module in order to see the changes.
